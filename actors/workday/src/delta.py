"""Tell me what changed since last time, not what exists.

Someone who schedules this daily does not want 500 rows every morning. They
want the three roles that opened overnight and the two that closed. Returning
the full board every run buries the signal and bills them for the burial.

So this keeps a snapshot of which jobs were present on the previous run, in a
named key-value store that survives between runs, and diffs against it.

Two design decisions worth stating plainly:

* **The snapshot is scoped to the exact input.** Change the company list or a
  filter and you get a fresh baseline rather than a flood of phantom "closed"
  rows for jobs you simply stopped asking about. The cost is that tweaking a
  filter re-emits everything once. That is the honest trade: a re-emitted run
  is annoying, a run that reports 400 jobs as closed when they are still open
  is a wrong answer.

* **Closed jobs are reported from the snapshot, not re-fetched.** By the time a
  posting disappears there is nothing left to fetch, so the row carries what
  was recorded when the job was last seen. Fields beyond identity are
  deliberately absent rather than stale.

# Named stores persist between runs; the default (unnamed) store is wiped with
# the run that created it, which would make every run look like the first one.
#
# The name has to be per-Actor. Actors run under limited permissions, and a
# limited Actor may only touch named storages it created itself. Every Actor
# here originally asked for the same "ats-job-monitor-state"; the first one to
# run created it and the rest got a ForbiddenError on open. The except below
# catches that, so nothing crashed - change detection just quietly degraded to
# "everything is new" on every run, billing the caller for the whole board
# daily instead of the handful of roles that actually moved.
#
# This took two attempts. The first added the suffix but read the Actor id
# from `get_env()["actor_id"]`, which does not exist: `get_env()` is keyed by
# option name, so the id is under "id" and APIFY_ACTOR_ID is merely the
# variable it was read from. The lookup returned None on every run, the code
# fell through to the bare prefix, and the fix shipped, built, and did
# nothing. Its test agreed with it only because the test fed the same wrong
# key to a fake. So: both keys are read here, and tests/delta_test.py now
# shapes its fake env like a real one and asserts the namespacing actually
# happens rather than that the function was called.
